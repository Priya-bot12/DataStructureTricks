1. XOR (exclusive OR) is a bitwise operation that is commonly used in many problems, particularly those that deal with finding pairs or duplicates. 
Truth Table for XOR:
A B A ^ B (Result)
0	0	  0
0	1  	1
1	0	  1
1	1 	0
Common Problems
-> Finding the Missing Number in an Array (Where all other numbers appear twice)
-> Finding the Single Non-Duplicated Element (in an array where every element appears twice except one)
-> Finding Two Non-Duplicated Elements (in an array where every element appears twice except two)

2. When you perform the bitwise AND (&) between num and -num, the result is a number that has only the rightmost set bit of num set to 1, and all other bits set to 0.
